    Welcome to our facial recognition system! We are a small team of engineering students who have built this system to
    simplify attendance tracking in college. Our goal is to provide a reliable and efficient way for professors and
    administrators to mark attendance while also reducing the workload and time spent on traditional methods.
    <br>
    Our facial recognition system uses advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify and verify the
    identity of students in real-time. We have designed this system with accuracy and security in mind, ensuring that
    only authorized individuals can access the system and data.
    <br>
    Our team understands the importance of data privacy and security, which is why we have implemented various measures
    to ensure that all personal information is kept safe and confidential. We follow strict data protection protocols
    and adhere to all relevant data protection regulations.
    <br>
    Our facial recognition system has been thoroughly tested and optimized to perform well in a variety of lighting and
    environmental conditions. It can also be easily integrated with existing attendance tracking systems, making it a
    cost-effective solution for colleges and universities.
    <br>
    We are proud to have developed a system that helps streamline attendance tracking in educational institutions. Our
    facial recognition system has already been adopted by several colleges, and we are committed to continuously
    improving and updating it to meet the evolving needs of the education sector.
    <br>
